# asana_buddy

# Asana Buddy is my first major project on my own! I hope you enjoy it.

# This application will store a library of asanas (AKA yoga poses). You can view the library to learn about each pose, and then create a randomized routine based on your preferences. 

# What is the difference between yoga and asana? If you're curious, check out this cool page from the Hindu American Foundation's (HAF) Take Back Yoga Project: https://www.hinduamerican.org/projects/hindu-roots-of-yoga#
