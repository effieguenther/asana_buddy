# Asana Buddy is my first major project on my own! I hope you enjoy it.

# This application will store a library of Asanas (AKA yoga poses). You can browse the library to learn about each pose, and then create a randomized routine based on your preferences. You can then follow the routine in real time with guided breathwork. 

# Why not just call it yoga? Well, I think the Hindu American Foundation's (HAF) Take Back Yoga Project explains it best:

# "Today, yoga is largely misunderstood to be and is practiced primarily as asana, or physical posture. Asana practice alone is shown to have a myriad of health benefits from lowering blood pressure, relief of back pain and arthritis, and boosting of the immune system. Increasingly, many believe asana practice to reduce Attention Deficit Disorder (AD/HD) in children, and recent studies have shown it improves general behavior and grades.

# And while practicing asana for improved health is perfectly acceptable, it is not the goal or purpose of yoga...

# ...Most of what is billed as yoga around the world is not the yoga described in the Yoga Sutras or any of the original texts. Rather it has morphed into a form of asana without faith, devotion, or understanding underlying it, and therefore, more akin to mere exercise.

# Today, one can register for a myriad of “yogas”: spinning+yoga, naked yoga, doga (yoga for dogs), hot yoga, yoga on a surfboard, the list is endless. New types of “yoga” seem to appear and disappear, it seems almost daily, and they are a far cry from the yoga described in the Yoga Sutras, Bhagavad Gita, or Upanishads. In today’s mass commercialization, the term “yoga” is loosely applied to the latest fitness creation that bears little to no resemblance to yoga as citta-vritti-nirodhah.

# The result of this has been a decline of yoga as an inward, spiritual quest or journey into a multi-million dollar commercialized industry.

# “Unfortunately, it is not good when the goal of yoga is money rather than God. Real yoga is not about money….If you want to benefit, think only of God, dedicate all your actions to God, and whatever comes your way is a gift – His gift to you.” – Jois

# This commercialization is problematic in general, but it is of particular to concern to Hindus who see yoga being delinked from its roots. And though yoga is a means of spiritual attainment for any and all seekers, irrespective of faith or no faith, its underlying principles are those of Hindu thought. For Hindus in America, who are often faced with “caste, cow, and karma” stereotypes in public school textbooks and mass media, the acknowledgement of yoga as a tremendous contribution of ancient Hindus to the world is important. This acknowledgement is not to imply ownership of yoga. No one owns yoga. Rather, it is an appreciation of the richness and universality of Hindu teachings."
